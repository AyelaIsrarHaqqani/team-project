**Mastering Git and GitHub for Collaboration. Key steps include:**

**Repository Setup:** Cloning a repository, creating branches, and making initial commits.

**Pull Request Workflow:** Merging a feature branch feature into main after adding main.py, followed by branch cleanup.

**Forking and Modifications:** Forking a lab repository Devops_Fork, editing README.md, and pushing changes.

**Undoing Changes:** Reverting a problematic commit and forcibly resetting the repository to an earlier state (using git revert and git reset --soft followed by git push --force).

**Collaboration:** Teaming up with groupmate, cloning repositories, and adhering to version control practices.

The following process highlights standard Git operations for collaboration, code management, and error correction, though forced pushes (--force) indicate overwriting remote history, a risky practice.
